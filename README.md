- A fictional Coffee Company plans to open N shops in the near future and needs to determine where they should be located knowing the following:
    - Most of the customers of this coffee brewer enjoy reading and borrowing books, so the goal is to locate those shops in such a way that all the city public libraries are within minimal walking distance.
- We use Chicago open data for this example.
- We implement a K-Median model to get the optimal location of our future shops.
